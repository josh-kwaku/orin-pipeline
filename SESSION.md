# Current Session: UI Beautification Planning

Last Updated: 2026-01-14

## What Was Done

### Created Beautification Plan for orin-chat-web
- Analyzed current UI implementation (4 pages + SnippetPicker)
- Defined iOS Messages/Music aesthetic direction
- Created comprehensive 4-phase plan:
  1. Design foundation (typography, colors, Framer Motion)
  2. Component beautification (Login, Chats, Conversation, NewChat, SnippetPicker)
  3. Shared UI components (Button, Input, GlassHeader, etc.)
  4. Polish & micro-interactions

## Files Created
- `orin-chat-web/BEAUTIFICATION_PLAN.md` - Full implementation plan

## Key Decisions
- **Aesthetic:** iOS Messages/Music - clean, fluid, vibrant
- **Platform:** Mobile-first
- **Motion library:** Framer Motion for spring animations
- **Typography:** Inter font with refined type scale
- **Colors:** Softer emerald gradients replacing harsh green

## Next Steps
- Implement beautification plan (Phase 1-4)
- Start with foundation (fonts, colors) then Login page
